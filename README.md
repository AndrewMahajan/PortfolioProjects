# Covid-19 Portfolio Project

In this project I created SQL queries to analyze Covid-19 Data and answer important questions such as:

-Which counties has the highest infection rate?

-What is the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country?

-What Countries have the Highest Death Count per Population?

-What percentage of the population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine?



 The below dashboard was created in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.mahajan/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16923146435660/Dashboard1url). to visualize the data
