# Covid-19 SQL/Tableau Portfolio Project

## Overview

In this project, I analyzed Covid-19 data from the CDC (February 2020-April 2021) and I created [SQL queries](https://github.com/AndrewMahajan/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid-19%20SQL%20Queries) to analyze data.

I wanted to answer important questions such as:

* Which counties has the highest infection rate?

* What is the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country?

* What Countries have the Highest Death Count per Population?




 The below dashboard was created in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.mahajan/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16923146435660/Dashboard1url) to visualize the data

As of April of 2021, the global numbers show total cases at 150 million, with total deaths at 3.1 million which repreents a total death percetage of 2.11%.

## Total Deaths Per Continent

Looking at the stats in a deeper level, Europe had the highest overall deaths with just above 1 million deaths followed by North America at around 850 thousand.

## Percentage Infected Per County

The above map visuliazation shows the percent infected per county. The darker red and orange areas show countries with a higher infected population and the lighter while the yellow areas show countries with a lower infected population percentage. United states and several parts of Europe show the highest percentage infected.

## Percentage Population Infected Trend

This shows a trend line of the percentage population infected and also forecasts 6 months into the future. As an example, the United States shows a percentage population infected of 8.63% as of April 2021 and 6 months forecasted in the future shows a percentage of 19.11%.
